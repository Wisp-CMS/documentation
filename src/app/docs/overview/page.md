The app comes with a world-class editor for authoring posts, we will learn more about the editor in the [publishing section](/docs/publishing).

## Content API

Content on the wisp platform is served via the Content API. It delivers published content to the world and can be accessed in a read-only manner by any client to render in a website, app or other embedded media.

Any frontend app can leverage on the Content API to serve content from wisp onto their interface. We also additionally provide a [Javascript client](/docs/js-sdk) to easily fetch content from popular JS frameworks like Next.js, Vite, Svelte, etc.

You will learn more about the API in the [Content API section](/docs/content-api).

## Your Frontend App

wisp is a full headless CMS which is completely agnostic of any particular front end or static site framework. 

It's compatible with just about any front-end you can throw at it - it doesnâ€™t even have to be a website!

We will be adding code examples and blog starter kits for you to quickly get started or draw inspiration from.
