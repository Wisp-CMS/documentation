## Why we create wisp?

Creating a blog can be a daunting task, especially when it comes to providing a seamless editing experience for both developers and content creators. Most of the time, managing a blog built with Markdown files limits the ability for non-technical team members to contribute content effectively. Additionally, handling images and other static assets can quickly become a hassle, as they need to be hosted separately or commingled with the codebase, leading to bloated repositories and slower load times for users.


## What makes wisp different?

wisp is a headless CMS designed to offer a solution to these common blogging challenges.

### A Focused Blogging Experience

What sets wisp apart from other headless CMS solutions is its laser-focus on providing a streamlined blogging experience. Unlike platforms that offer customizable content types, which can be overkill for startups or entrepreneurs seeking a simple blog integration, wisp is tailored to deliver a lightweight and efficient solution for this specific use case.

### The Intuitive Editor

At the core of wisp lies a beautiful and intuitive editor inspired by the likes of Medium and Notion. This editor empowers content creators with a familiar and user-friendly interface, making it a breeze to craft and format blog posts. Uploading images is as simple as dragging and dropping or copying and pasting them directly into the editor, eliminating the need for manual asset management or cluttering the codebase.

## Who is wisp for?

wisp is designed with small startup teams, and agencies in mind. By separating the roles of developers and content creators, wisp streamlines the blogging workflow, ensuring that both parties can focus on their respective strengths without unnecessary friction.

## How to get started with wisp?

Setting up wisp is a straightforward process:

1. Sign up for a wisp account and obtain a team ID.
2. Start creating blog posts using the intuitive editor.
3. Integrate the fetching of blog posts into your Next.js projects, either by leveraging wisp's API directly or by utilizing the provided JavaScript client.

As you delve deeper into the documentation, you'll find framework-specific integration guides, empowering you to harness the full potential of wisp and elevate your blogging experience to new heights.
